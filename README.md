# JL-Digital

* A MERN Stack powered E-Commerce App with Credit Card Payment along with Admin Dashboard.
* Implement login, add to cart, payment gateways, order management system and so much more.
* Deployed fully functioning E-commerce app to production by using Digital Ocean cloud servers.
* Use Braintree (A PayPal Company) for handling Payments. Braintree is hands down the best payment gateway that could possibly use in a production site for both PayPal and Credit Card payments.
* Add the custom Domain name(Namecheap/Godaddy).
* Use the Cloudflare's CDN to supercharge the speed of the site and also use free SSL to secure the app.
